It works by blocking the effects of opioids in the brain, quickly restoring normal breathing in a person whose breathing has slowed or stopped due to opioid use."

        "text": "Opioids such as heroin, fentanyl, and prescription painkillers (like oxycodone and morphine) attach to specific receptors in the brain that control breathing. In an overdose, these receptors become overly activated, slowing breathing to dangerous levels. Naloxone acts as an opioid antagonist â€” it binds to those same receptors but blocks and displaces the opioids, reversing their life-threatening effects within minutes."
